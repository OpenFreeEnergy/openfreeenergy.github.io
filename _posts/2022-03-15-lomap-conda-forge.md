We've released [Lomap](http://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/Lomap) 2.0 on
conda-forge. Lomap is a useful tool for create atom mappings, and we've taken
responsibility for maintaining it, since it was no longer actively developed by
the academic team that created it (David Mobley's group).

To distinguish this line from the previous versions of Lomap, we're referring
to this package as `lomap2`. It can be installed via ``conda`` with the command:

`conda install -c conda-forge lomap2`

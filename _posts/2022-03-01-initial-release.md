We're proud to announce the very first public alpha release of OpenFE!

We plan to release as we develop, in order to give the community access to our
code as soon as possible, and elicit early feedback.

This release focused on developing our model for a network of ligands for
alchemical transformation, including identifying which atoms are mutating
between ligands as well as visualizing the transformation.

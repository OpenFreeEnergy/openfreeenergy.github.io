description: >-
  Gufe (grand unified free energy) is designed for use by **developers** of
  free energy methods.  It provides object models for expressing the chemical
  systems and the alchemical transformations between them (mappings) to form
  free energy networks.
  Protocols can then be applied to provide an estimate of the free energy difference
  between different systems.

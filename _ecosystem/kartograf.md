    description: >-
      Kartograf is a 3D-first atom mapper. This allows it to avoid some
      problems, particularly those around chirality, that can occur with 2D
      mappers (e.g., those focused on common substructure.) Ben can expand this
      a little if he wants.

This is where Ben should write a lot more detail about Kartograf.

The Open Free Energy fund is currently searching for software scientists
to join our fully remote team.
Ideal candidates will be expected to have a foundation in molecular simulation
and experience developing associated software.
One or more of the following would also be beneficial:
- familiarity with alchemical free energy calculations
- knowledge of cheminformatics algorithms
- experience with Python and software engineering best practices
- track record of contributing to open source projects
- history of collaborating between different projects

- Work collaboratively with other software scientists to implement features, write tests, debug failures, and craft documentation to reach release milestones for open source projects owned by the effort developed openly on GitHub
- Contribute to open source software projects within the larger biomolecular simulation ecosystem when upstream contributions will help solve issues for the larger community
- Follow best practices for Python software development, including participating in code reviews, writing unit tests, and adhering to documentation standards
- Work closely with members of the Technical Advisory Committee to design software and APIs and solve problems with algorithms, methodologies, or issues with tools outside the project
- Assist in benchmarking and assessment of the tools produced by the effort
- Assist in packaging software developed by the effort to minimize user friction
- Work to identify and solve technical or usability issues with project members and wider user community

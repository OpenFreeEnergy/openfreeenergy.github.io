  The Open Free Energy (OpenFE) initiative is dedicated to the development of
  open-source tools for binding free energy calculations to guide
  pharmaceutical drug design and discovery.
---

### OPEN SOURCE

Our software is [developed in public on
GitHub](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy) and is released under the permissive
MIT license.

### BINDING FREE ENERGY

We develop tools that enable our users to easily and efficiently calculate
binding free energies for networks of molecular systems.

### DRUG DESIGN AND DISCOVERY

Our tools are designed with pharmaceutical lead optimization in mind, and we
work closely with our board members in industry to develop tools that meet the
needs of real-world users.


OpenFE is hosted by the [Open Molecular Software Foundation](https://omsf.io).

## Mission
Promote, foster and advance science in Computational Biophysics through the
development of precision-driven open software.

## Vision
By 2027, be the world reference in open molecular-software development.

## Values

**Skepticism:** There is no such thing as absolute or eternal truth.

**Open-mindedness:** We are eager to accept different knowledge as it is built
on facts, data and evidence.

**Willingness to learn:** Science is a lifelong journey.  Passion for
intellectual development: we build paths to enlightenment.

## What we do?

We believe in developing rational, science-based and sustainable open solutions
to humanityâ€™s problems. We do this by offering complete computational
technologies aimed at building knowledge about biological systems of interest.
Our goal is to support the pharmaceutical industry in the intelligent drug
design process to enable innovative treatments for those who need them.

Open Free Energy sits at the nexus of academia and industry.
Our software is designed to be stable, reliable, and thoroughly tested, as
required by industry, while also providing tools that make it easier for
academics to develop the new methods that will become the next industry
standards. We build bridges that enable both academic and industrial users to
benefit from bleeding edge methods being developed by free energy experts.

Our work includes developing packages aimed at enhancing interoperability of
existing software, as well as taking maintenance responsibilities for useful
existing packages in need of an active maintainer.

Open Free Energy is a hosted software project of the Open Molecular Software
Foundation (OMSF). The Open Free Energy Fund, managed by OMSF, receives
donations and uses them to support continued work on Open Free Energy.

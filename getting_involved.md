There are three ways to get involved with Open Free Energy:
 - Companies can join the consortium by contributing to the Open Free Energy Fund.
 - Academic research labs can collaborate through membership in our Technical Advisory Council.
 - Individuals can contribute code on [github](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy).

To get in touch, please email us at `OpenFreeEnergy@omsf.io`


Joining the Consortium
----------

Open Free Energy is driven by a small team of professional scientists and software engineers funded by an industry consortium hosted by the [Open Molecular Software Foundation](https://omsf.io). 
Companies that are interested in using our software are encouraged to contribute the Open Free Energy Fund. 
The Fund's charter defines membership in different tiers based on the contribution amount. Members participate in our Advisory Board to guide the activites they fund.

Academic Collaborations
--------------

A group of academics who we call the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) advise us on scientific directions. If you are an academic investigator actively involved in developing free energy methods, and are interested in contributing your expertise to the project, you may reach out to us to discuss the possibility of joining the TAC.

Software Contributions
-------------

If you're new to the OpenFE Ecosystem, our [showcase notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/OpenFreeEnergy/ExampleNotebooks/blob/main/showcase/openfe_showcase.ipynb) and [documentation](https://docs.openfree.energy/en/stable/index.html) are great places to get familiar with the project. As you look through these, or if you're already an active user, opening [issues](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/issues) for feature requests or documentation improvements is a great way to help us improve our code.
 
If you're a software developer and want to make a bug fix or improvement, you can open a [pull request](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/pulls) and our team will take a look. We love to receive external contributions, but our team is small so please be patient regarding our response time!

Joining the Consortium
----------------------

If your company is interested in open-source tools for biomolecular simulation,
and would benefit from having free tools for free energy calculations, 
please consider funding the project and joining the consortium.

Consortium members benefit from:
- Dedicated private support and training
- Prioritised feature requests
- Accelerating the development of the next generation of tools
- Ensuring the ongoing maintenance of key software

All contributions are made via our non-profit host organisation [The Open Molecular Software Foundation](https://www.omsf.io).
To get in touch please email us at `OpenFreeEnergy@omsf.io`

Collaborations
--------------

We are also actively seeking academic collaborations in the free energy space,
